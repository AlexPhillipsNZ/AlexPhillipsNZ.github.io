	<h1>Software Engineering 2017-S1 Alex Phillips</h1>
	<p>Software engineering has taught me about about work ehtic, self discipline & problem solving. The layout and directive this 
	semester has been a distinguishable change compared to the structure of other papers. This paper has felt alot more
	applicable to the real world as we have been given similar tasks that employers would most likely give us. But with that change
	has come new unforseen challenges to face but with that, more opportunities to learn. At the beginning of this course I was unware
	of how dependent I was on lesson structure in order to learn, but by the end of the course I found myself setting my own goals &
	tasks and having a plan to follow through and complete.</p>
