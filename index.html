	<h1>Software Engineering 2017-S1 Alex Phillips</h1>
	<p>Software engineering has taught me about work ethic, self-discipline and problem solving. The layout and directive this 
	semester has been a distinguishable change compared to the structure of other papers. This paper has felt a lot more
	applicable to the real world as we have been given similar tasks that employers would most likely give us. But with that change
	has come new unforeseen challenges to face but with that, more opportunities to learn. At the beginning of this course I was unware
	of how dependent I was on lesson structure to learn, but by the end of the course I found myself setting my own goals and
	tasks and having a plan to follow through and complete. </p>
	
	<h3> Each Task </h3>
	
	<p> Designing the Database: The challenges of normalizing such a large database that was potentially going to go live was tricky at first
	knowing that any potential error could mean a real-world response also added weight to the task. But with a large group it was
	good to create an environment where everyone could share and then collect all the similarities within our ideas and put them to the
	final schema.</p>
	
	<p> Starting the ORM: Quickly adapting to what this software was and what it could do then helping initialize it. </p>
	
	<p> Building Authentication Login: When comforted with the task to complete an authentication login
	form for Node.js (Something I had never used before) I first went about it in a very slow manner, I watched introductory lessons
	online explaining the backend of the software. Although this style of learning is very comprehensive it is also very slow.
	I grew more constable with the idea of building software without knowing full inner workings and when troubles popped up
	problem solving through them and learning that way provided more finished product results. </p>
	
	<p> Securing the website: Finally I was put onto a task I had enough background in to really show some of my talents.
	but with that still able to set up similar real world environments which I could use my skills against. I learned how to use VMs
	and create secure networks across them without effecting or 'leaking' onto other networks. I got hands on use with current cutting
	edge software in security and could find and document a handful of flaws within our web app. These faults were fixed by the front
	end team</p>
	
	<p> Documentation: At the end, I got the job to make a technical document. I enjoy this because I got to see the project fully put
	together and learned how all the parts I didnâ€™t work on contributed to the overall project. </p>
